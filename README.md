I often go on bike trips, during which I enjoy beautiful landscapes and a healthy lifestyle. I also like to visit different places, discover new cultures, and learn about the history of cities and corners of the world. Additionally, I often reach for interesting books that allow me to relax and develop my interests. Thanks to such diverse interests, I find a balance between work and private life, which positively affects my motivation and creativity at work.
